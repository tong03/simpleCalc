This is the last project for the fundamental series of the ODIN Project. The goal is to create a simple calculator UI and to be able to process inputs for simple calculations.


End Project: This project was interesting to implement. The first part of the project was challenging in figuring out the different divs layout for the calculator, as well as manipulating them to the desired visual with CSS flexbox. Additionally, the second part of implementing dynamic JS also proved to a challenge in figuring out how the different divs will be interacting with one another to update changes visually. On top of making a dynamic webpage, I was able to apply css class specificity to enhance priority to the attribute changes for desired classes.
